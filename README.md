# Insert Special Symbol

This extension is fairly straight-forward: it allows you to insert symbols that are otherwise hard to enter with a normal keyboard.

## Features

```replaceSelection```

This command replaces the current selection(s) with the corresponding value in a lookup table.
For instance, `pi` becomes `π` and `rho` becomes `ρ`.
Currently, only Greek letters are accepted. In future versions,
the set of available replacements with be configurable.

You may also replace a hexadecimal Unicode escape sequence such as `\u03b1`.
